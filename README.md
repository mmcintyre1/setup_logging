## LOG module
This module showcases a few use cases and some plug and play code you could use to integrate logging in a more coherent and easier manner into your projects.  

## How to use
You can clone the repo, and deposit the log module into your project directory.  There is a config file that exists in the config/ directory that has some baseline setups for logger objects, so when you configure your root logger via the `setup_logging` function, just add the relative or absolute path to that logging config file. 

In the samples/ directory, you can see a simple invocation of the log setup, as well as some additional helpful hints about logging in general.
